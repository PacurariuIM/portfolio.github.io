      <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-1">Cloud & DevOps Engineering</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-2">AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp (ExamPro) • Feb 2023 – July 2023</p>
      <p>During the AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp, I had the opportunity to work on an ambitious project where we designed a micro messaging app capable of sending ephemeral messages that automatically delete after a set period. This complex undertaking involved both backend and frontend development and required a diverse skill set and technical expertise.</p>
      A significant focus of the bootcamp was troubleshooting. We faced numerous challenges in making the app work, which led to long, collaborative troubleshooting sessions with my fellow students. We supported each other through the process, sharing insights and solutions, which fostered a strong sense of teamwork and camaraderie. Out of more than 10,000 students enrolled, only about 100 finished, and I was proud to be one of the few—around 30 of us— recognized as Gold Squad Members for our exceptional commitment and problem-solving skills.</p> 
      Throughout the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with a wide array of AWS services and tools, such as AWS Lambda, ECS, ECR, Fargate, and CloudFormation. I utilized Python and Flask for backend development while building the frontend with JavaScript and React. For data storage, we employed PostgreSQL and DynamoDB, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval. The development process required significant perseverance and dedication, as we tackled complex issues together. I honed my skills in terminal operations, bash scripting, and working with YAML files. As part of the CI/CD pipeline, I worked with AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline, gaining valuable insights into DevOps practices and the importance of automation in modern software development. I also explored Cognito for user authentication and learned the basics of Ruby, further expanding my programming skills. </p>
      This bootcamp not only deepened my technical expertise as a cloud engineer but also strengthened my understanding of network architecture and DevOps principles. The experience taught me the importance of perseverance and collaboration in overcoming challenges, and I emerged from it with both enhanced skills and a strong sense of accomplishment.
